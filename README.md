# Pattern_Matching_And_Pseudocommands_Assembly

Pattern matching is a simple program in assembly that checks if string "ababaa" is in a string that is given as input. If the "ababaa" string can be found in the input then the program returns the position where the "ababaa" string starts in the input.

Pseudocommands beqr and load address are implemented.
